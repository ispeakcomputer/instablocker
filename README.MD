# InstaBlock - Watches a Instagram profile and blocks it when they unblock you

Keep trolls at bay. Watches a profile and then if that profile unblocks you it will then block
that profile.

Used in hopes to keep trolls from reporting media and / or leaving harassing communications. On Instagram a troll can block you and then 
unblock you to harass or report your photos and then block you again.

**WARNING** 
This was tested and when testing at a 6 second delay the profile page returns a error page after about 20+ minutes.

My research suggests that Instagram may rate limit at 200 actions per hour which is in line with when I was banned.The ban lasted 24 
hours.

Setting above 18 seconds of delay may be needed if my idea of how to by pass the rate limit is correct. You would definitely be ok by
checking the trolls profile every 10 minutes though try at your own risk. 

I have decided not to run the automation due to the risk. Accounts can be banned with automation. My research shows that instagram will at 
times ban permently.
