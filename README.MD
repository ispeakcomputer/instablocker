# InstaBlock - Watches a Instagram profile and blocks it when they unblock you

Keep trolls at bay. Watches a profile using Seleium webdriver (Chrome browser) and then if that profile unblocks you it will then block
that profile.

Used in hopes to keep stalkers or trolls from reporting media and / or leaving harassing communications. On Instagram a troll can block you and then 
unblock you to harass or report your photos and then block you again.

## WARNING: YOU COULD GET THE BAN HAMMER TO THE FACE 
This was tested and when testing at a 6 second delay the profile page returns a error page after about 20+ minutes.

My research suggests that Instagram may rate limit their offical API at 200 actions per hour which is in line with when I was banned. 

**The ban lasted 24 hours.** Thats right, Im a criminal now.

Setting many more seconds of delay may be needed if my idea of how to by pass the rate limit is correct. You would definitely be ok by
checking the trolls profile every 10 minutes though try at your own risk. 

**Accounts can be banned with automation.**

My research shows that instagram will at times ban permanently and **its against the TOS**

**Use at your own risk**
