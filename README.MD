# InstaBlock - Watches a profile and blocks it when able. 

Keep trolls at bay. Watches a profile and then if that profile unblocks you it will then block
that profile. Used in hopes to keep trolls from reporting media and / or leaving harassing communications. 

**WARNING** This was tested and when testing at a 6 second delay and profile returns a error page after about 20+ minutes. 
My research suggests that Instagram may rate limit at 200 actions per hour which is in line with when I was banned. Setting 
above 18 seconds of delay may be needed if my idea of how to by pass the rate limit is correct. I have deceided not to run the automation due to the risk. Accounts can be banned with automation.
